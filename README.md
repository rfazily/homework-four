# GW Coding Bootcamp - Homework #3 

## Overview

The purpose of homework #4 was to create a timed quiz that also deducted time when you answered a question wrong. The quiz should also provide the ability of keeping a high score within the users local storage. 

When you start the quiz, it will set off the timer in the upper right corner. You will then be presented with five questions. As you answer each question, the quiz will tell you if you are 'correct' or 'wrong'. If you answer is wrong, it will deduct five seconds from the timer in the upper right corner. The quiz will end once either the timer is up, or if you finished answering all the questions and will present the user with a score of the remaining time (if any). 

The quiz will prompt you to enter in your initials to add your score to the high score list. This list will be saved in your local storage until your click on 'clear high scores' or refresh the page.
